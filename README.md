## Description

Here, I have created 1 food diary that has 2 different diaries combined. From the homepage, you have access to both: the Dinner Diary and the Mocktail Diary. Both diaries will lead you to wonderful recipes that when clicked, will show you all the recipe information. Through the app, I have bulit multiple features: you are able to add a recipe, update the recipe or just simply delete a recipe if you dislike it! To create this project, I have used multiple different technologies such as, Mongoose, Express, React, Node and more.

## Let's check out the app

## Upcoming Features

At sometime in the near future, I plan to upgrade this app and add multiple features. As of right now, some of the features I plan to incorporate are:

- Search Bar
- Appetizer Diary
- Dessert Diary
- feedback page

There are so many ideas that I have for this app, the list would just be too long.
