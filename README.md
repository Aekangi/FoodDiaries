## Description

I've created a food application that has 2 different sections. One section will lead to multiple different food images that are clickable. Once clicked, you will see the recipes difficulty level, ingredients needed for the recipe, and a list of directions on how to make the recipe. The other section will be the same except it will portray mocktail images with the recipe of that mocktail. If a follower lands on a recipe that they feel needs to be altered, there will be a tab to update the recipe.
